Linear Regression:

   Linear regression is a statistical method for modeling relationships between a dependent variable with a given set of independent variables. Simple linear regression is an approach for predicting a response using a single feature. In order to provide a basic understanding of linear regression, we start with the most basic version of linear regression, i.e. Simple linear regression.

REGRESSION-PREDICTION-OF-RED WINE's QUALITY:

   I'm predict RED WINE's QUALITY Dataset using Simple Linear Regression: START: I get dependent variable is Precipitation columns and independent variable is quality columns. Then unwanted coulums are deleted using DROP key. locate and reshape the values of X and Y. Then using the MatPlotLib to visible a Scatter plot of X,Y. split the values of x and y using train & test methods. Thus the simple linear regression was implemented.

RESULT:

  Using sklearn find the mean squard error and mean absolute error. [mean_squared_error(y_test,y_predict)=1.8446748632743275] [mean_absolute_error(y_test,y_predict)=1.061364374698876].

LOOKER STUDIO: 

  I'm also predict the same dataset in looker studio Using table to fixed acidity,volatile acidity,citricacid,residual sugar,chlorides,free sulphurdioxide,total sulphur dioxide,density,pH	sulphates,alcohol,quality, I find relationship between WINE's quality and count using Bar chart and Pie chart, I find relationship between acidity's and quality  using pie chart, and I find Relationship between quality and Precipitaion using line chart
